This is a simple Footy tipping app

It is using the following technologies

* Rust
* SQLX - Rust based async database access library
* Postgresql - Easily migrated to other SQLX supported backend
* Yew - Rust based reactive Front-end web framework

This project is basically a learning exercise, but also provides a manageable sized sample application for anyone to get an idea of how allthese things can go together. 

The app as is is not scaleable, but the core technologies are.
